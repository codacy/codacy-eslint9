# The filename should follow the filename naming convention (filename-naming-convention)

Allows you to enforce a consistent naming pattern for the filename of the specified file.

## Rule Details

This rule aims to format the filename of the specified file. This rule uses the glob match syntax to match target files and declare the naming pattern for the filename.

There are six basic naming conventions built into this rule, including `CAMEL_CASE`, `PASCAL_CASE`, `SNAKE_CASE`, `KEBAB_CASE`, `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` and `FLAT_CASE`.

And there is also a special naming convention for Next.js page router project, which is `NEXT_JS_PAGE_ROUTER_FILENAME_CASE`, you can use it to ensure the filename of the page router is consistent with the naming convention. You can read more about it under [`NEXT_JS_PAGE_ROUTER_FILENAME_CASE`](#NEXT_JS_PAGE_ROUTER_FILENAME_CASE).

| Formatting  | Name                   |
| ----------- | ---------------------- |
| helloWorld  | `CAMEL_CASE`           |
| HelloWorld  | `PASCAL_CASE`          |
| hello_world | `SNAKE_CASE`           |
| hello-world | `KEBAB_CASE`           |
| HELLO_WORLD | `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` |
| helloworld  | `FLAT_CASE`            |

If the rule had been set as follows:

```js
...
'check-file/filename-naming-convention': ['error', { 'src/services/*.js': 'PASCAL_CASE' }],
...
```

Examples of **incorrect** filename with path for this rule:

```sh
src/services/downloadService.js
src/services/downloadservice.js
src/services/download-service.js
src/services/download_service.js
```

Examples of **correct** filename with path for this rule:

```sh
src/services/DownloadService.js
src/download-service.js // this file is not be specified by the target pattern, so it is skipped
```

In addition to the built-in naming conventions, you can also set custom naming patterns using glob match syntax. The following code shows an example of how to ensure that all your `js` files are named begin with `__`:

```js
...
'check-file/filename-naming-convention': ['error', {'**/*.js': '__+([a-z])'}],
...
```

**Tip:** To selecte all your `js` files, your can use the glob expression `**/*.js`.

### `NEXT_JS_PAGE_ROUTER_FILENAME_CASE`

The `NEXT_JS_PAGE_ROUTER_FILENAME_CASE` aims to support a wide range of filename naming convention in Next.js Page Router projects. If you would like to enforce a camelCase naming convention for your filename, but also support Next.js' Dynamic segments, Catch-all segments and Optional Catch-all Segments, this pattern is for you.

```js
...
'check-file/filename-naming-convention': [
  'error',
  {
    'src/**/*': 'NEXT_JS_PAGE_ROUTER_FILENAME_CASE',
  },
],
...
```

While `NEXT_JS_PAGE_ROUTER_FILENAME_CASE` covers many naming cases, it's possible that some cases may be missing. If you come across any missing cases, I encourage you to open an issue and provide the necessary details. Your feedback will help me improve and enhance the naming convention.

### Prefined Match Syntax

Prefined match syntax allow you to capture specific part of the target file pattern and use it in your naming convention pattern. This syntax is particularly useful when you want to make a file to be named the same as its parent folder.

To use prefined match in your rule set, you can use the `<index>` syntax. The index refers to the position where the glob matcher occurs in the target file pattern expression, starting with `0`. Read more about glob capture groups in the [micromatch documentation](https://github.com/micromatch/micromatch#capture).

If the rule had been set as follows:

```js
...
'check-file/filename-naming-convention': ['error', { '**/*/!(index).*': '<1>' }, { 'ignoreMiddleExtensions': true }],
...
```

Examples of **incorrect** filename with path for this rule:

```sh
src/Portal/type.ts
src/Portal/base.tsx
```

Examples of **correct** filename with path for this rule:

```sh
src/Portal/index.ts
src/Portal/Portal.test.tsx
src/Portal/Portal.tsx
src/Portal/Portal.types.ts
```

### Options

#### naming pattern object

The key is used to select target files, while the value is used to declare the naming pattern for the filename. You can specify a different naming pattern for different files. The plugin will only check files you explicitly selected:

```js
export default [
  {
    plugins: {
      'check-file': checkFile,
    },
    rules: {
      'check-file/filename-naming-convention': [
        'error',
        {
          '**/*.{jsx,tsx}': 'CAMEL_CASE',
          '**/*.{js,ts}': 'KEBAB_CASE',
        },
      ],
    },
  },
];
```

#### rule configuration object

##### `ignoreMiddleExtensions`

If `true`, the rule will ignore the middle extensions of the filename.

In some cases, you may want to ignore the middle extensions of the filename. For example, you want to lint the base name of the config and test/spec filesâ€”e.g., `babel.config.js` and `date.test.js`, you can do so by setting the `ignoreMiddleExtensions` option to `true`, and the rule will only validate its base name, in this case the base name will be `babel` and `date`.

```js
export default [
  {
    plugins: {
      'check-file': checkFile,
    },
    rules: {
      'check-file/filename-naming-convention': [
        'error',
        {
          '**/*.{jsx,tsx}': 'CAMEL_CASE',
          '**/*.{js,ts}': 'KEBAB_CASE',
        },
        {
          ignoreMiddleExtensions: true,
        },
      ],
    },
  },
];
```

##### `errorMessage`

Customizes the error message displayed when a file's filename doesn't match the declared naming pattern. It offers two placeholders for dynamic content:

- `{{ target }}`: Represents the filename of the non-matching file.
- `{{ pattern }}`: Represents the naming pattern.

```js
export default [
  {
    plugins: {
      'check-file': checkFile,
    },
    rules: {
      'check-file/filename-naming-convention': [
        'error',
        { '**/*/!(index).*': '<1>' },
        {
          errorMessage:
            'The file "{{ target }}" does not match file naming convention defined("{{ pattern }}") for this project, see contribute.md for details',
        },
      ],
    },
  },
];
```
