# Disallow `import` declarations which import extraneous modules (`n/no-extraneous-import`)

ðŸ’¼ This rule is enabled in the following [configs](https://github.com/eslint-community/eslint-plugin-n#-configs): ðŸŸ¢ `recommended-module`, âœ… `recommended-script`.

<!-- end auto-generated rule header -->

If an `import` declaration's source is extraneous (it's not listed in your `package.json`), the program may work locally but can break after dependencies are re-installed. This can cause issues for your team/contributors. If a declaration source is extraneous yet consistently works for you and your team, it might be a transitive dependency (a dependency of another dependency). Transitive dependencies should still be added as an explicit dependency in your `package.json` to avoid the risk of a dependency potentially changing or removing the transitive dependency.

Additionally, the transitive dependency could be a dev dependency, meaning your code could work in development but not in production.

This rule disallows `import` declarations of extraneous modules.
