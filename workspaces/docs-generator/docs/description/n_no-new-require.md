# n/no-new-require

📝 Disallow `new` operators with calls to `require`.

<!-- end auto-generated rule header -->

The `require` function is used to include modules that exist in separate files, such as:

```js
var appHeader = require('app-header');
```

Some modules return a constructor which can potentially lead to code such as:

```js
var appHeader = new require('app-header');
```

Unfortunately, this introduces a high potential for confusion since the code author likely meant to write:

```js
var appHeader = new (require('app-header'));
```

For this reason, it is usually best to disallow this particular expression.

## 📖 Rule Details

This rule aims to eliminate use of the `new require` expression.
